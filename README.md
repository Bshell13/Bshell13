### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Brandon Shellenberger and I am currently studying for an M.S. in Data Analytics from Northwest Missouri State University. These are a few of my projects I have worked on through courses and outside of the class setting. I have been a High School Mathematics Teacher for 5 years and am exploring a career change in to Data Analytics. I want to dive into Sports Analytics, but starting off enywhere would be amazing!

#### Current Projects
I am currently working on the a couple of projects:
- [NCAA March Madness Predictions](https://github.com/Bshell13/march_madness/tree/main)
- [Battleship](https://github.com/Bshell13/battleship)
I am in the early stages of both projects, so only the structure and some simple code is shown.

If you have any insight into the world of data analytics or want to have a conversation, please reach out!
